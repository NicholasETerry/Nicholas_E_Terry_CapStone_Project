How confident are you in the news you read? Throughout the history of the United States, people have been divided on pollical believes. This is not anything new.  What is new though is that instead of people being divided on breaking away from the tyranny of a foreign country, or abolishing slavery, or the ethnics of fighting a war on foreign soil, people are divided over… everything…Or at least they think they are. The purpose of this application is to supply its users with political articles that have been rated and reviewed by other individuals of varies backgrounds and expertise, to provide a clearer image into what is and is not true in the world of political news.
